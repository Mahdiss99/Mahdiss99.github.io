      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu/">MAE Department at UC Davis</a>, working in the <a href="https://nazarilab.ucdavis.edu/">CORE Lab</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEr1ZzMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Nazari</a>. My research focuses on system identification, decision-making, and path-planning for non-cooperative multi-agent systems, with applications in autonomous vehicles and human-robot interaction. I work on both theoretical frameworks, including game theory, optimization and Koopman operator, and simulations in Python or Julia. My journey in engineering has taught me to build on foundational principles to create practical solutions.</p>

  <!-- Additional About Me Content Below Image -->
  <div class="about-me-content full-width">
    <p> My capstone project—a tactile sensor—enhanced my expertise in mechanical analysis and electromechanical desing, embedded systems and C/C++ programmingas well as prototyping. I also have hands-on experience with CAD tools, like SolidWorks, rapid prototyping, and interdisciplinary problem-solving.</p>
    <p>Through my Ph.D. research, I have advanced my skills in Python, MATLAB, and Julia, applying them to complex simulations and modeling. Co-leading my lab's RC car team on developing an F1Tenth RC platform has deepened my ability to collaborate and apply control strategies in real-world scenarios. I approach every project as a chance to learn, contribute, and push boundaries in robotics and automation.</p>
