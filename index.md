      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu/">MAE Department at UC Davis</a>, working in the <a href="https://nazarilab.ucdavis.edu/">CORE Lab</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEr1ZzMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Nazari</a>.
      Specializing in robotics, controls, and planning, I address interaction-aware path planning and control in complex multi-agent environments with applications in autonomous driving and human-robot interactions. Simply speaking, I am developing a novel method to efficiently find an optimal feasible trajectory while predicting how other agents will react to ego's actions in the shared environment by combining path planning with data-driven dynamic </p>

    <p> system modeling. Aside the mathematical framework, I am creating a physics-based simulation environment for conflicting driving scenarios via Python and Julia. My journey in engineering has taught me to build on foundational principles to create practical solutions. </p>
    <p> Gaining hands-on experience in embedded systems, sensor integrations, and troubleshooting while designing and fabricating a soft tactile sensor in my undergrads equipped me with low-level programmming skills, computer-aided desig, rapid prototyping, and interdisciplinary problem-solving.</p>
    <p> Through my Ph.D. research, I have advanced my skills in Python, MATLAB, and Julia, applying them to complex simulations and modeling. Leading and mentoring my lab's RC car team on developing an F1Tenth RC platform has deepened my ability to collaborate and apply control strategies in real-world scenarios. I approach every project as a chance to learn, contribute, and push boundaries in robotics and automation.</p>
