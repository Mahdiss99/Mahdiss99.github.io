      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Robotics and Control at the <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu/">MAE Department in University of California, Davis</a>, where I work in the <a href="https://nazarilab.ucdavis.edu/">CORE Lab</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEr1ZzMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Nazari</a> on developing interaction-aware decision-making and path-planning algorithms for autonomous and multi-agent systems. My research explores how autonomous agents can anticipate and respond to each other’s actions, using tools from game theory, optimal control and MPC, and data-driven modeling. I design algorithms that compute safe, efficient trajectories while predicting how surrounding agents may react—an essential </p>

    <p> capability for autonomy in complex, interactive environments. My work spans theory, algorithms, and implementation. I develop fast Nash-seeking and interaction-aware MPC methods for multi-agent decision-making, build data-driven dynamic models (including Koopman-based approaches), and create physics-based simulation pipelines in Python that integrate CARLA for large-scale evaluation. </p>
    <p> Before pursuing my Ph.D., I gained extensive hands-on experience in robotics and mechatronics at the University of Tehran, where I designed and prototyped a soft magnetic tactile sensor, built embedded control and calibration systems (STM32/Arduino), and developed electronics and firmware for real-time sensing and control. </p>
    <p> Alongside my research, I enjoy mentoring and technical leadership. I guide a team of undergraduate researchers developing deep-learning models for vehicle behavior and trajectory prediction, and I supervised the development of our lab’s F1Tenth autonomous racing platform, coordinating work through a master’s student team lead while contributing to key sensing modules such as wheel-speed encoders and IR-based state estimation. </p>
    <p> Across all my work, I am motivated by a simple idea: autonomous systems should think and act intelligently in the real world. I strive to build algorithms and tools that make this possible, combining analytical methods with computational models, simulation with real-world constraints, and theory with practical implementation. Whether modeling multi-agent interactions, designing control architectures, or building robotic systems from the ground up, I aim to contribute to autonomy that is more adaptive, reliable, and aware of the world around it. </p>
