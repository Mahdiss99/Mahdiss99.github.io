    <!-- Course 3: Dynamics -->
    <div class="course">
      <h2>Dynamics </h2><h3><p class="institution">University of Tehran, Iran</p> </h3>
      <span class="semester">Mar 2020 â€“ June 2022</span>
      <p class="description">As part of a team, I contributed to the creation of a solution manual for the textbook "Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics, J.L.Meriam, L.G. Kraige". In addition to grading assignments and projects, I co-designed course projects to enhance students' understanding of kinematic and kinetic analysis as well as using simulators. I also recorded a tutorial on using the ADAMS software, providing students with additional resources.</p>
